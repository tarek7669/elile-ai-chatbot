# 🇴🇲 Omani AI Therapist

## 🌟 Project Overview

This project aims to develop an AI-powered **Therapeutic Guide** designed specifically to provide mental health support and counseling in a manner that is fully aligned with the authentic cultural values of Omani society and the noble principles of tolerant Islamic Sharia.  

The guide focuses on providing a safe and supportive environment, while considering the paramount importance of family, community cohesion, and privacy in communication.

This AI therapist utilizes a **voice (or text) interface** to enable seamless user interaction. It features the ability to understand primary emotions, activate specialized safety protocols in crisis situations, and deliver concise, direct responses.
