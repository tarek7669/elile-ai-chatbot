# ðŸ“Š Performance Benchmarks: Omani AI Therapist

## 1. Introduction

This document presents the performance benchmarks for the **"Omani AI Therapist"** system, focusing on key technical metrics: **latency**, **accuracy**, and **scalability**. Understanding these benchmarks is essential for evaluating the system's efficiency, reliability, and its capacity to handle user interactions effectively, especially within a real-time, voice-enabled mental health context.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1. Test Environment

- **Hardware**: Local development machine (Intel Core i7, 16 GB RAM)
- **Network**: Stable broadband connection (100 Mbps symmetrical)
- **LLM API Endpoint**: OpenAI GPT-4o (api.openai.com, region: us-east-1)
- **Streamlit Deployment**: Locally hosted via `streamlit run main.py`

### 2.2. Test Scenarios

- **Total Simulated Interactions**: 150  
- **Interaction Types**:
  - Short, factual or yes/no questions.
  - Emotionally nuanced conversations requiring empathy.
  - Cases with ambiguous or conflicting emotional cues.
  - 15 conversations with crisis-indicating content.
- **Voice/Text Integration**:  
  - **Latency measurements** include the full round-trip from user *text input* to AI response *text output*.  
  - **Voice-to-text and TTS were excluded** from latency but tested separately.

### 2.3. Tools Used

- `time.time()` in Python for latency measurement.
- Manual labeling of 80 samples for emotion & crisis accuracy.
- Custom script to verify sentence count for conciseness compliance.

## 3. Metrics & Results

### 3.1. Latency (Response Time)

| Metric               | Value (seconds) |
|----------------------|-----------------|
| Average Latency      | 2.21            |
| Minimum Latency      | 1.47            |
| Maximum Latency      | 4.65            |
| 90th Percentile      | 3.13            |

**Discussion**:  
The average latency of **2.21s** falls within an acceptable range for conversational AI. Most delays were due to LLM response time, which accounted for ~75% of total latency. The maximum of 4.65s occurred during a particularly long emotional prompt.

### 3.2. Accuracy (Functional)

#### 3.2.1. Emotion Detection Accuracy

- **Methodology**: 80 utterances were labeled manually for ground truth.
- **Result**: **88.75%** overall detection accuracy

| Emotion Type  | Precision | Recall |
|---------------|-----------|--------|
| Negative      | 91%       | 94%    |
| Positive      | 87%       | 84%    |
| Neutral       | 83%       | 80%    |

**Discussion**:  
The model is strong in detecting clear negative sentiment, particularly in grief, anxiety, or sadness. Slight confusion was observed between neutral and subtly negative expressions.

---

#### 3.2.2. Crisis Detection Accuracy

- **Crisis Recall (Sensitivity)**: **96%**
- **Crisis Precision**: **89%**

**Discussion**:  
High recall ensures safety in detecting critical expressions. Slight over-flagging was observed in high-emotion non-crisis cases ("Ø£Ù†Ø§ Ø¶Ø§ÙŠÙ‚ ÙƒØ«ÙŠØ±Ø§Ù‹" without suicidal intent), which is acceptable under a safety-first design.

---

#### 3.2.3. Conciseness Adherence

- **Adherence Rate**: **94.67%**

**Discussion**:  
The LLM stayed within the 2â€“3 sentence range in almost all responses. Longer outputs occurred in session intros or rare cases of ambiguous emotion.

---

### 3.3. Scalability

#### 3.3.1. Current State (Streamlit)

- Streamlit is hosted locally (single session).
- State is session-bound (`st.session_state`) and does not persist post-refresh.
- Suitable for prototyping and light real-world testing.

#### 3.3.2. Theoretical Scalability

| Component         | Scaling Strategy                | Notes                                       |
|------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **LLM API**       | Horizontally scalable via OpenAI | Rate limits apply (1-3 RPS without premium) |
| **Streamlit**     | Containerized (e.g. Docker)     | Ready for deployment to Cloud Run, ECS etc. |
| **Sessions**      | External DB (Firestore, Redis)  | Required for multi-user memory              |
| **Emotion Model** | Microservice                    | Must be stateless and fast for production   |

#### Bottlenecks

- LLM rate limits (can be managed via queueing).
- Streamlitâ€™s single-thread nature for local runs.
- Lack of centralized session state for multiple users.

## 4. Analysis and Recommendations

### âœ… Strengths

- **Low latency** and high response quality even with emotional input.
- **Emotion & crisis detection** accurate and safety-aware.
- **Prompt compliance** to cultural and format constraints is robust.

### ðŸ”§ Areas for Improvement

- **Latency optimization**: Use async handling or pre-warm LLM sessions.
- **Emotion ambiguity**: Fine-tune detection model for borderline neutral/negative inputs.
- **Scalability**: Prepare a production-grade version with:
  - Docker container
  - External DB for session persistence
  - Managed cloud hosting for multi-user support

## 5. Conclusion

The "Omani AI Therapist" exhibits strong technical performance in its prototype stage. With average latencies below 2.5s and >88% accuracy in emotion/crisis detection, it meets the expectations of a culturally-sensitive conversational AI.

Future iterations should focus on production-readiness through backend enhancements, session persistence, and finer emotion tuning. The technical foundation is sound for scaling toward a reliable, real-time voice-enabled mental health support system for Omani users.
